RFEP Subproblems domain reduction.py
    Description
        Implements the domain reduction algortihm that eliminates not promising stations from path
        It solves the complete model with the domain reduction and without the domain reduction and exports the results to Excel for analysis

    Pseudocode
        Read data
        Enters a loop to solve subproblems
            Reduce the domain of each subproblem
            Updates the sets and required parameters (distance and fuel consumption in segments)
        Solve the complete RFEP after domain reduction
        Exports the solution of the RFEP after domain reduction
        Solve the RFEP without domain reduction
        Export the solution of the RFEP
